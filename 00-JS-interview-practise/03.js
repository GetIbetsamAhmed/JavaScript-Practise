const shape = {
    radius: 10,
    diameter() {
        return this.radius * 2;
    },
    perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,

console.log(shape.diameter());
console.log(shape.perimeter());

// ( Res ) => 20 and NaN
// ( Reason )
// Note that the value of diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function.
// With arrow functions, the this keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! 
// This means that when we call perimeter, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope 
// (window for example).
// There is no value radius on that object, which returns NaN.
